![Kirby Tracker](.github/title.png)

**Tracker** is a plugin for [Kirby 3](https://getkirby.com) to track content changes and create panel logs or front-end notifications in member areas.

## On privacy

**Before using this plugin, please think about the privacy implications.** You will be processing personal data of your users: their name, the date of their change and meta information about their change. This requires you to follow the privacy laws in your jurisdiction. Please consult a lawyer in case of doubt.

This plugin was initially conceived to create a dashboard for a private members area where all users consented to share their changes with the other users.

## Example

```php
<?php
$notifications = new Hananils\TracksCollection('notifications');
$notifications
  ->filterBy('datetime', '>=', $start->format('Y-m-d'))
  ->sortBy('datetime', 'asc')
  ->limit(10);
?>

<h1>Recent changes</h1>
<ol>
<?php foreach ($notifications as $notification): ?>
    <li>
        <?= $notification
          ->track()
          ->toReference()
          ->title() ?>
    </li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ol>
```

# Tracked data

Tracker will create a SQLite datebase in `site/logs/tracker.sqlite`. It will create two tables:

## tracks

Tracker will create a log of all change in this database:

- `id`: the internal id
- `user`: the Kirby user id
- `datetime`: the timestamp of the change
- `kid`: the Kirby id of the current context (page id, user id, file id)
- `model`: the model of the current context (page, user, file)
- `action`: the name of the action, referring to the Kirby hook, see https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/plugins/hooks
- `changes`: meta information about the change, e. g. the field names affected or the page status before and after

## notifications

Tracker will also create a list of all related pages, users and files that are affected by a change:

- `id`: the internal id
- `kid`: the related Kirby id
- `datetime`: the timestamp of the change
- `track`: the tracked change
- `status`: whether the page, user or file has been added, untouched or removed as reference

## toReference()
